                   Use Cases for In-Network Computing
                     draft-irtf-coinrg-use-cases-00

Abstract

   Computing in the Network (COIN) comes with the prospect of deploying
   processing functionality on networking devices, such as switches and
   network interface cards.  While such functionality can be beneficial
   in several contexts, it has to be carefully placed into the context
   of the general Internet communication.  This document discusses some
   use cases to demonstrate how real applications can benefit from COIN
   and to showcase essential requirements that have to be fulfilled by
   COIN applications.

1.  Introduction

   The Internet is a best-effort network that offers limited guarantees
   regarding the timely and successful transmission of packets.  Data
   manipulation and protocol functionality is generally provided by the
   end-hosts while the network is kept simple and only intended as a
   "store and forward" packet facility.  This design-choice is suitable
   for a wide variety of applications and has helped in the rapid growth
   of the Internet.  However, there are several domains which, e.g.,
   demand a number of strict performance guarantees that cannot be
   provided over regular best-effort networks or require more closed
   loop integration to manage data flows.  In this context, flexibly
   distributing the computation tasks across the network can help to
   achieve the guarantees and increase the overall performance.

   However, different domains and different applications have different
   requirements and it remains unclear and the topic of academic
   research whether there can be a common solution to all COIN scenarios
   or if solutions have to be tailored to each scenario.

   This document presents a series of applications and their
   requirements to illustrate the importance of COIN for realizing
   advanced applications.  Based on these, the draft aims to create a
   taxonomy of elementary COIN scenarios with the goal of guiding future
   research work.

2.  Terminology

   Programmable network devices (PNDs): Network devices, such as network
   interface cards and switches, which are programmable, e.g., using P4
   or other languages.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Taxonomy

   The use cases in this draft aim at outlining the specific
   capabilities that in-networking capabilities may bring to their
   realization.  To attain this goal, we will use the following taxonomy
   to describe each of the use cases:

   1.  Description: explanation of the use case behavior

   2.  Characterization: explanation of the services that are being
       realized and the semantics of interactions in the use case

   3.  Existing solutions: if existing, outline current methods of
       realizing the use case

   4.  Opportunities and research questions for COIN: outline how PNDs
       may support or improve on the use case case in terms of
       performance and other metrics and state essential questions that
       are suitable for guiding research.

   5.  Requirements: describe the requirements for any solutions that
       may need development along the opportunities outlined in item 4

Internet-Draft               COIN Use Cases                February 2021


4.  Industrial Use Cases

   The industrial domain is characterized by diverse sets of
   requirements which often cannot be provided over regular best-effort
   networks.  Consequently, there is a large number of specialized
   applications and protocols designed to give the required strict
   performance guarantees, e.g., regarding real-time capabilities.
   Time-Sensitive-Networking [TSN] as an enhancement to the standard
   Ethernet, e.g., tries to achieve these requirements on the link layer
   by statically reserving shares of the bandwidth.  In the Industrial
   Internet of Things (IIoT), however, more and more parts of the
   industrial production domain are interconnected.  This increases the
   complexity of the industrial networks, makes them more dynamic, and
   creates more diverse sets of requirements.  In these scenarios,
   solutions on the link layer alone are not sufficient.

   The challenge is to develop concepts that can satisfy the dynamic
   performance requirements of modern industrial networks.  COIN
   presents a promising starting point because it allows to flexibly
   distribute computation tasks across the network which can help to
   manage dynamic changes.  As specifying general requirements for the
   industrial production domain is difficult due to the mentioned
   diversity, this document next characterizes and analyzes different
   scenarios to showcase potential requirements for the industrial
   production domain.

4.1.  IIoT Network Scenario

   Common components of the IIoT can be divided into three categories as
   illustrated in Figure 1.  Following
   [I-D.mcbride-edge-data-discovery-overview], EDGE DEVICES, such as
   sensors and actuators, constitute the boundary between the physical
   and digital world.  They communicate the current state of the
   physical world to the digital world by transmitting sensor data or
   let the digital world interact with the physical world by executing
   actions after receiving (simple) control information.  The processing
   of the sensor data and the creation of the control information is
   done on COMPUTING DEVICES.  They range from small-powered controllers
   close to the EDGE DEVICES, to more powerful edge or remote clouds in
   larger distances.  The connection between the EDGE and COMPUTING
   DEVICES is established by NETWORKING DEVICES.  In the industrial
   domain, they range from standard devices, e.g., typical Ethernet
   switches, which can interconnect all Ethernet-capable hosts, to
   proprietary equipment with proprietary protocols only supporting
   hosts of specific vendors.

4.2.  In-Network Control / Time-sensitive applications

4.2.1.  Description

   The control of physical processes and components of a production line
   is essential for the growing automation of production and ideally
   allows for a consistent quality level.  Traditionally, the control
   has been exercised by control software running on programmable logic
   controllers (PLCs) located directly next to the controlled process or
   component.  This approach is best-suited for settings with a simple
   model that is focused on a single or few controlled components.

   Modern production lines and shop floors are characterized by an
   increasing amount of involved devices and sensors, a growing level of
   dependency between the different components, and more complex control
   models.  A centralized control is desirable to manage the large
   amount of available information which often has to be pre-processed
   or aggregated with other information before it can be used.  PLCs are
   not designed for this array of tasks and computations could
   theoretically be moved to more powerful devices.  These devices are
   no longer close to the controlled objects and induce additional
   latency.

4.2.2.  Characterization

   A control process consists of two main components as illustrated in
   Figure 2: a system under control and a controller.  In feedback
   control, the current state of the system is monitored, e.g., using
   sensors and the controller influences the system based on the
   difference between the current and the reference state to keep it
   close to this reference state.

    reference
      state      ------------        --------    Output
   ---------->  | Controller | ---> | System | ---------->
              ^  ------------        --------       |
              |                                     |
              |   observed state                    |
              |                    ---------        |
               -------------------| Sensors | <-----
                                   ---------

                  Figure 2: Simple feedback control model.

   Apart from the control model, the quality of the control primarily
   depends on the timely reception of the sensor feedback, because the
   controller can only react if it is notified of changes in the system
   state.  Depending on the dynamics of the controlled system, the
   control can be subject to tight latency constraints, often in the
   single-digit millisecond range.  While low latencies are essential,
   there is an even greater need for stable and deterministic levels of
   latency, because controllers can generally cope with different levels
   of latency, if they are designed for them, but they are significantly
   challenged by dynamically changing or unstable latencies.  The
   unpredictable latency of the Internet exemplifies this problem if
   off-premise cloud platforms are included.

4.2.3.  Existing Solutions

   Control functionality is traditionally executed on PLCs close to the
   machinery and these are only rarely upgraded.  Further, the PLCs
   require vendor-specific implementations and are often hard to update
   which makes such control processes inflexible and difficult to
   manage.  Moving computations to more freely programmable devices thus
   has the potential of significantly improving the flexibility.

4.2.4.  Opportunities and Research Questions for COIN

   Control models, in general, can become involved but there is a
   variety of control algorithms that are composed of simple
   computations such as matrix multiplication.  These are supported by
   some PNDs and it is thus possible to compose simplified
   approximations of the more complex algorithms and deploy them in the
   network.  While the simplified versions induce a more inaccurate
   control, they allow for a quicker response and might be sufficient to
   operate a basic tight control loop while the overall control can
   still be exercised from the cloud.

   Opportunities:

   *  Speed up control update rates by leveraging privileged position in
      the network

   The problem, however, is that networking devices typically only allow
   for integer precision computation while floating-point precision is
   needed by most control algorithms.  Additionally, computational
   capabilities vary for different available PNDs.  Yet, early
   approaches like [RUETH] and [VESTIN] have already shown the general
   applicability of such ideas, but there are still a lot of open
   research questions not limited to the following:

   Research Questions:

   *  How can one derive the simplified versions of the overall
      controller?

      -  How complex can they become?

      -  How can one take the limited computational precision of
         networking devices into account when making them?

   *  How does one distribute the simplified versions in the network?

   *  How does the overall controller interact with the simplified
      versions?

4.2.5.  Requirements

   Req 4.2.1: Control approaches MUST provide stable/deterministic
   latencies.

   Req 4.2.2: Control approaches SHOULD provide low latencies.

Internet-Draft               COIN Use Cases                February 2021


   Req 4.2.3: The interaction between the in-network control function
   and the overall controller SHOULD be explicit.

   Req 4.2.4: Actions of the control approaches SHOULD be explicit to
   the overall controller.

   Req 4.2.5: Actions of the control approaches MUST be overridable by
   the overall controller.

4.3.  Large Volume Applications

4.3.1.  Description

   In the IIoT, processes and machines can be monitored more effectively
   resulting in more available information.  This data can be used to
   deploy machine learning (ML) techniques and consequently help to find
   previously unknown correlations between different components of the
   production which in turn helps to improve the overall production
   system.  Newly gained knowledge can be shared between different sites
   of the same company or even between different companies [PENNEKAMP].

   Traditional company infrastructure is neither equipped for the
   management and storage of such large amounts of data nor for the
   computationally expensive training of ML approaches.  Similar to the
   considerations in Section 4.2, off-premise cloud platforms offer
   cost-effective solutions with a high degree of flexibility and
   scalability.  While the unpredictable latency of the Internet is only
   a subordinate problem for this use case, moving all data to off-
   premise locations primarily poses infrastructural challenges.

4.3.2.  Characterization

   Processes in the industrial domain are monitored by distributed
   sensors which range from simple binary (e.g., light barriers) to
   sophisticated sensors measuring the system with varying degrees of
   resolution.  Sensors can further serve different purposes, as some
   might be used for time-critical process control while others are only
   used as redundant fallback platforms.  Overall, there is a high level
   of heterogeneity which makes managing the sensor output a challenging
   task.

   Depending on the deployed sensors and the complexity of the observed
   system, the resulting overall data volume can easily be in the range
   of several Gbit/s [GLEBKE].  Using off-premise clouds for managing
   the data requires uploading or streaming the growing volume of sensor
   data using the companies' Internet access which is typically limited
   to a few hundred of Mbit/s.  While large networking companies can
   simply upgrade their infrastructure, most industrial companies rely

   on traditional ISPs for their Internet access.  Higher access speeds
   are hence tied to higher costs and, above all, subject to the supply
   of the ISPs and consequently not always available.  A major challenge
   is thus to devise a methodology that is able to handle such amounts
   of data over limited access links.

   Another aspect is that business data leaving the premise and control
   of the company further comes with security concerns, as sensitive
   information or valuable business secrets might be contained in it.
   Typical security measures such as encrypting the data make in-network
   computing techniques hardly applicable as they typically work on
   unencrypted data.  Adding security to in-network computing
   approaches, either by adding functionality for handling encrypted
   data or devising general security measures, is thus an auspicious
   field for research which we describe in more detail in Section 7.

4.3.3.  Existing Solutions

   Current approaches for handling such large amounts of information
   typically build upon stream processing frameworks such as Apache
   Flink.  While they allow for handling large volume applications, they
   are tied to performant server machines and upscaling the information
   density also requires a corresponding upscaling of the compute
   infrastructure.

4.3.4.  Opportunities and Research Questions for COIN

   There are at least two concepts that might be suitable for reducing
   the amount of transmitted data in a meaningful way using in-network
   computing:

   1.  filtering out redundant or unnecessary data

   2.  aggregating data by applying pre-processing steps within the
       network

   Both concepts require detailed knowledge about the monitoring
   infrastructure at the factories and the purpose of the transmitted
   data.

4.3.4.1.  Traffic Filtering

   Sensors are often set up redundantly, i.e., part of the collected
   data might also be redundant.  Moreover, they are often hard to
   configure or not configurable at all which is why their resolution or
   sampling frequency is often larger than required.  Consequently, it
   is likely that more data is transmitted than is needed or desired.




Kunze, et al.            Expires 21 August 2021                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft               COIN Use Cases                February 2021


   A trivial idea for reducing the amount of data is to filter out
   redundant or undesired data before it leaves the premise using simple
   traffic filters that are deployed in the on-premise network.  There
   are different approaches to how this topic can be tackled.  A first
   step would be to scale down the available sensor data to the data
   rate that is needed.  For example, if a sensor transmits with a
   frequency of 5 kHz, but the control entity only needs 1 kHz, only
   every fifth packet containing sensor data is let through.
   Alternatively, sensor data could be filtered down to a lower
   frequency while the sensor value is in an uninteresting range, but
   let through with higher resolution once the sensor value range
   becomes interesting.  It is important that end-hosts are informed
   about the filtering so that they can distinguish between data loss
   and data filtered out on purpose.

   Opportunities:

   *  Semantic packet and stream filtering at line-rate

   *  Filtering based on packet header and payload, as well as multi-
      packet information

   Challenges/Research Questions:

   *  How can traffic filters be designed?

   *  How can traffic filters be coordinated and deployed?

   *  How can traffic filters be changed dynamically?

   *  How can traffic filtering be signaled to the end-hosts?

4.3.4.2.  In-Network (Pre-)Processing

   There are manifold computations that can be performed on the sensor
   data in the cloud.  Some of them are very complex or need the
   complete sensor data during the computation, but there are also
   simpler operations which can be done on subsets of the overall
   dataset or earlier on the communication path as soon as all data is
   available.  One example is finding the maximum of all sensor values
   which can either be done iteratively at each intermediate hop or at
   the first hop, where all data is available.

   Using expert knowledge about the exact computation steps and the
   concrete transmission path of the sensor data, simple computation
   steps can be deployed in the on-premise network to reduce the overall
   data volume and potentially speed up the processing time in the
   cloud.

   Related work has already shown that in-network aggregation can help
   to improve the performance of distributed ML applications [SAPIO].
   Investigating the applicability of stream data processing techniques
   to programmable networking devices is also interesting, because
   sensor data is usually streamed.  In this context, the following
   research questions can be of interest:

   Opportunities:

   *  Semantic data aggregation

   *  Computation across multiple packets and leveraging packet payload

   Challenges/Research Questions:

   *  Which (pre-)processing steps can be deployed in the network?

      -  How complex can they become?

   *  How can applications incorporate the (pre-)processing steps?

   *  How can the programming of the techniques be streamlined?

4.3.5.  Requirements

   Req 4.3.1: Filters or preprocessors MUST conform to application-level
   syntax and semantics.

   Req 4.3.2: Filters or preprocessors MAY leverage packet header and
   payload information

   Req 4.3.3: Filters or preprocessors SHOULD be reconfigurable at run-
   time

4.4.  Industrial Safety

4.4.1.  Description

   Despite increasing automation in production processes, human workers
   are still often necessary.  Consequently, safety measures have a high
   priority to ensure that no human life is endangered.  In traditional
   factories, the regions of contact between humans and machines are
   well-defined and interactions are simple.  Simple safety measures
   like emergency switches at the working positions are enough to
   provide a decent level of safety.






Kunze, et al.            Expires 21 August 2021                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft               COIN Use Cases                February 2021


   Modern factories are characterized by increasingly dynamic and
   complex environments with new interaction scenarios between humans
   and robots.  Robots can either directly assist humans or perform
   tasks autonomously.  The intersect between the human working area and
   the robots grows and it is harder for human workers to fully observe
   the complete environment.

   Additional safety measures are essential to prevent accidents and
   support humans in observing the environment.  The increased
   availability of sensor data and the detailed monitoring of the
   factories can help to build additional safety measures if the
   corresponding data is collected early at the correct position.

4.4.2.  Characterization

   Industrial safety measures are typically hardware solutions because
   they have to pass rigorous testing before they are certified and
   deployment-ready.  Standard measures include safety switches and
   light barriers.  Additionally, the working area can be explicitly
   divided into 'contact' and 'safe' areas, indicating when workers have
   to watch out for interactions with machinery.

   These measures are static solutions, potentially relying on
   specialized hardware, and are challenged by the increased dynamics of
   modern factories where the factory configuration can be changed on
   demand.  Software solutions offer higher flexibility as they can
   dynamically respect new information gathered by the sensor systems,
   but in most cases they cannot give guaranteed safety.  Yet, it is
   worthwhile to investigate whether such solutions can introduce
   additional safety measures.

4.4.3.  Existing Solutions

   Note: Will be added later.

4.4.4.  Opportunities and Research Questions for COIN

   Software-based solutions can take advantage of the large amount of
   available sensor data.  Different safety indicators within the
   production hall can be combined within the network so that
   programmable networking devices can give early responses if a
   potential safety breach is detected.  A rather simple possibility
   could be to track the positions of human workers and robots.
   Whenever a robot gets too close to a human in a non-working area or
   if a human enters a defined safety zone, robots are stopped to
   prevent injuries.  More advanced concepts could also include image
   data or combine arbitrary sensor data.

   safety measures.

   measures.

5.  Immersive Experiences

5.1.  Mobile Application Offloading

5.1.1.  Description

   The scenario can be exemplified in an immersive gaming application,
   where a single user plays a game using a VR headset.  The headset
   hosts functions that "display" frames to the user, as well as the
   functions for VR content processing and frame rendering combining
   with input data received from sensors in the VR headset.  Once this
   application is partitioned into micro-services and deployed in an
   app-centric execution environment, only the "display" micro-service
   is left in the headset, while the compute intensive real-time VR
   content processing micro-services can be offloaded to a nearby
   resource rich home PC, for a better execution (faster and possibly
   higher resolution generation).

5.1.2.  Characterization

   Partitioning an application into micro-services allows for denoting
   the application as a collection of functions for a flexible
   composition and a distributed execution, e.g., most functions of a
   mobile application can be categorized into any of three, "receiving",
   "processing" and "displaying" function groups.






Kunze, et al.            Expires 21 August 2021                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft               COIN Use Cases                February 2021


   Any device may realize one or more of the micro-services of an
   application and expose them to the execution environment.  When the
   micro-service sequence is executed on a single device, the outcome is
   what you see today as applications running on mobile devices.
   However, the execution of functions may be moved to other (e.g., more
   suitable) devices which have exposed the corresponding micro-services
   to the environment.  The result of the latter is flexible mobile
   function offloading, for possible reduction of power consumption
   (e.g., offloading CPU intensive process functions to a remote server)
   or for improved end user experience (e.g., moving display functions
   to a nearby smart TV).

   Figure 3 shows one realization of the above scenario, where a 'DPR
   app' is running on a mobile device (containing the partitioned
   Display(D), Process(P) and Receive(R) micro services) over an SDN
   network.  The packaged applications are made available through a
   localized 'playstore server'.  The application installation is
   realized as a 'service deployment' process, combining the local app
   installation with a distributed micro-service deployment (and
   orchestration) on most suitable AppCentreS ('processing server').

   Such localized deployment could, for instance, be provided by a
   visiting site, such as a hotel or a theme park.  Once the
   'processing' micro-service is terminated on the mobile device, the
   'service routing' (SR) elements in the network routes requests to the
   previously deployed 'processing' micro-service running on the
   processing server' AppCentre over an existing SDN network.  As an
   extension to the above scenarios, we can also envision that content
   from one processing micro-service may be distributed to more than one
   display micro-service, e.g., for multi/many-viewing scenarios.

5.2.  Extended Reality (XR)

5.2.1.  Description

   Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) taken together as
   Extended Reality (XR) are at the center of a number of advances in
   interactive technologies.  While initially associated with gaming and
   entertainment, XR applications now include remote diagnosis,
   maintenance, telemedicine, manufacturing and assembly, autonomous
   systems, smart cities, and immersive classrooms.

5.2.2.  Characterization

   XR is one example of the Multisource-Multidestination Problem that
   combines video, haptics, and tactile experiences in interactive or
   networked multi-party and social interactions.  Thus, XR is difficult
   to deliver with a client-server cloud-based solution as it requires a
   combination of: stream synchronization, low delays and delay
   variations, means to recover from losses and optimized caching and

   rendering as close as possible to the user at the network edge.  Many
   XR services that involve video holography and haptics, require very
   low delay or generate large amounts of data, both requiring a careful
   look at data filtering and reduction, functional distribution and
   partitioning.  Hence, XR uses recent advances in in-network
   programming, distributed networks, orchestration and resource
   discovery to support the XR advanced immersive requirements.  It is
   important to note that the use of in-network computing for XR does
   not imply a specific protocol but targets an architecture enabling
   the deployment of the services.  This includes computing in the nodes
   from content source to destination.

5.2.3.  Existing Solutions

   Related XR or XR-enabling solutions using in-network computation or
   related technologies include:

   *  Enabling Scalable Edge Video Analytics with Computing-In-Network
      (Jun Chen Jiang of the University of Chicago): this work brings a
      periodical re-profiling to adapt the video pipeline to the dynamic
      video content that is a characteristic of XR.  The implication is
      that "need tight network-app coupling" for real time video
      analytics.

   *  VR journalism, interactive VR movies and meetings in cyberspace
      (many projects PBS, MIT interactive documentary lab, Huawei
      research - references to be provided): typical VR is not made for
      multiparty and these applications require a tight coupling of the
      local and remote rendering and data capture and combinations of
      cloud (for more static information) and edge (for dynamic
      content).

   *  Local rendering of holographic content using near field
      computation (heritage from advances cockpit interactions - looking
      for non military papers): a lot has been said recently of the
      large amounts of data necessary to transmit and use holographic
      imagery in communications.  Transmitting the near field
      information and rendering the image locally allows to reduce the
      data rates by 1 or 2.

   *  ICE-AR [ICE] project at UCLA (Jeff Burke): while this project is a
      showcase of the NDN network artchitecture it also uses a lof of
      edge-cloud capabilities for example for inter-server games and
      advanced video applications.

5.2.4.  Opportunities and Research Questions for COIN

   Opportunities:

   In-network computing for XR profits from the heritage of extensive
   research in the past years on Information Centric Networking, Machine
   Learning, network telemetry, imaging and IoT as well as distributed
   security and in-network coding.  The opportunities include:

   *  Reduced latency: the physical distance between the content cloud
      and the users must be short enough to limit the propagation delay
      to the 20 ms usually cited for XR applications; the use of local
      CPU and IoT devices for range of interest (RoI) detection and
      fynamic rendering may enable this.

   *  Video transmission: better transcoding and use of advanced
      context-based compression algorithms, pre-fetching and pre-caching
      and movement prediction not only in the cloud.

   *  Monitoring: telemetry is a major research topic for COIN and it
      enables to monitor and distribute the XR services.

   *  Network access: push some networking functions in the kernel space
      into the user space to enable the deployment of stream specific
      algorithms for congestion control and application-based load
      balancing based on machine learning and user data patterns.

   *  Functional decomposition: functional decomposition, localization
      and discovery of computing and storage resources in the network.
      But it is not only finding the best resources but qualifying those
      resources in terms of reliability especially for mission critical
      services in XR (medicine for example).  This could include
      intelligence services.

   Research Questions:

   There is a need for more research resource allocation problems at the
   edge to enable interactive operation and quality of experience in VR.
   These include multi-variate and heterogeneous goal optimization
   problems requiring advanced analysis.  Image rendering and video
   processing in XR leverages different HW capabilities combinations of
   CPU and GPU.  Research questions include:

   *  Can current programmable network entities be sufficient to provide
      the speed required to provide and execute complex filtering
      operations that includes metadata analysis for complex and dynamic
      scene rendering?

   *  How can the interoperability of CPU/GPU be optimized to combine
      low level packet filteting with the higher layer processors needed
      for image processing and haptics?

   *  Can the use of joint learning algorithms across both data center
      and edge computers be used to create optimal functionality
      allocation and the creation of semi-permanent datasets and
      analytics for usage trending resulting in better localization of
      XR functions?

   *  Can COIN improve the dynamic distribution of control, forwarding
      and storage resources and related usage models in XR?

5.2.5.  Requirements

   XR requirements include the need to provide real-time interactivity
   for immersive and increasingly mobile immersive applications with
   tactile and time-sensitive data and high bandwidth for high
   resolution images and local rendering for 3D images and holograms.
   Since XR deals with personal information and potentially protected
   content XR must also provide a secure environment and ensure user
   privacy.  Additionally, the sheer amount of data needed for and
   generated by the XR applications can use recent trend analysis and
   mechanisms, including machine learning to find these trends and
   reduce the size of the data sets.  The requirements can be summarized
   as:

   Req 5.2.1: Allow joint collaboration.

   Req 5.2.2: Provide multi-views.

   Req 5.2.3: Include extra streams dynamically for data intensive
   services, manufacturing and industrial processes.

   tunneling, session virtualization and loss protection.

   Req 5.2.15: Use AI/ML for trend analysis and data reduction when
   appropriate.

5.3.  Personalised and interactive performing arts

5.3.1.  Description

   This use case covers live productions of the performing arts where
   the performers and audience are in different physical locations.  The
   performance is conveyed to the audience through multiple networked
   streams which may be tailored to the requirements of individual
   audience members; and the performers receive live feedback from the
   audience.

   There are two main aspects: i) to emulate as closely as possible the
   experience of live performances where the performers and audience are
   co-located in the same physical space, such as a theatre; and ii) to
   enhance traditional physical performances with features such as
   personalisation of the experience according to the preferences or
   needs of the audience members.

   Examples of personalisation include:

   *  viewpoint selection such as choosing a specific seat in the
      theatre or for more advanced positioning of the audience member's
      viewpoint outside of the traditional seating - amongst, above or
      behind the performers (but within some limits which may be imposed
      by the performers or the director for artistic reasons);

Internet-Draft               COIN Use Cases                February 2021


   *  augmentation of the performance with subtitles, audio-description,
      actor-tagging, language translation, advertisements/product-
      placement, other enhancements/filters to make the performance
      accessible to disabled audience members (removal of flashing
      images for epileptics, alternative colour schemes for colour-blind
      audience members, etc.).

5.3.2.  Characterization

   There are several chained functional entities which are candidates
   for in-network processing.

   *  Performer aggregation and editing functions

   *  Distribution and encoding functions

   *  Personalisation functions

      -  to select which of the existing streams should be forwarded to
         the audience member

      -  to augment streams with additional metadata such as subtitles

      -  to create new streams after processing existing ones: to
         interpolate between camera angles to create a new viewpoint or
         to render point clouds from the audience member's chosen
         perspective

      -  to undertake remote rendering according to viewer position,
         e.g. creation of VR headset display streams according to
         audience head position - when this processing has been
         offloaded from the viewer's end-system to the in-network
         function due to limited processing power in the end-system, or
         to limited network bandwidth to receive all of the individual
         streams to be processed.

   *  Audience feedback sensor processing functions

   *  Audience feedback aggregation functions

   These are candidates for in-network processing rather than being
   located in end-systems (at the performers' site, the audience
   members' premises or in a central cloud location) for several
   reasons:

   *  personalisation of the performance to audience preferences and
      requirements makes it unfeasible for this to be done at the
      performer premises: it will require large amounts of processing



Kunze, et al.            Expires 21 August 2021                [Page 22]

      power to process individual personalised streams as well as large
      amounts of network bandwidth to transmit personalised streams to
      each viewer.

   *  rendering of VR headset content to follow viewer head movements
      has an upper bound on lag to maintain viewer QoE.

   *  viewer devices may not have the processing-power to undertake the
      personalisation or the viewers' network may not have the capacity
      to receive all of the constituent streams to undertake the
      personalisation functions.

   *  there are strict latency requirements for the live and interactive
      aspects that require the deviation from the direct path between
      performers and audience is minimised, reducing the opportunity to
      leverage large-scale processing capabilities at centralised data-
      centres.

5.3.3.  Existing solutions

   To be added.

5.3.4.  Opportunities and Research Questions for COIN

   Opportunities:

   *  See Characterization.

   Research Questions:

   *  Where should the aggregation, encoding and personalisation
      functions be located?  Close to the performers or close to the
      audience members?

   *  How far away from the direct network path from performer to
      audience can they be located, considering the latency implications
      of path-stretch and the availability of processing capacity?

   *  How to achieve network synchronisation across multiple streams to
      allow for merging, audio-video interpolation and other cross-
      stream processing functions that require time synchronisation for
      the integrity of the output?

5.3.5.  Requirements

   The chain of functions and propagation over the interconnecting
   network segments for performance capture, aggregation, distribution,
   personalisation, consumption, capture of audience response, feedback
   processing, aggregation, rendering should be achieved within an upper
   bound of latency (the tolerable amount is to be defined, but in the
   order of 100s of ms to mimic performers perceiving audience feedback,
   such as laugher or other emotional responses in a theatre setting).

6.  Infrastructure Services

6.1.  Distributed AI

6.1.1.  Description

   There is a growing range of use cases demanding for the realization
   of AI capabilities among distributed endpoints.  Such demand may be
   driven by the need to increase overall computational power for large-
   scale problems.  Other solutions may desire the localization of
   reasoning logic, e.g., for deriving attributes that better preserve
   privacy of the utilized raw input data.

6.1.2.  Characterization

   Examples for large-scale AI problems include biotechnology and
   astronomy related reasoning over massive amounts of observational
   input data.  Examples for localizing input data for privacy reasons
   include radar-like application for the development of topological
   mapping data based on (distributed) radio measurements at base
   stations (and possibly end devices), while the processing within
   radio access networks (RAN) already constitute a distributed AI
   problem to a certain extent albeit with little flexibility in
   distributing the execution of the AI logic.

6.1.3.  Existing Solutions

   Reasoning frameworks, such as TensorFlow, may be utilized for the
   realization of the (distributed) AI logic, building on remote service
   invocation through protocols such as gRPC [GRPC] or MPI [MPI] with
   the intention of providing an on-chip NPU (neural processor unit)
   like abstraction to the AI framework.

   NOTE: material on solutions like ETSI MEC and 3GPP work will be added
   here later

Internet-Draft               COIN Use Cases                February 2021


6.1.4.  Opportunities and Research Questions for COIN

   Opportunities:

   *  supporting service-level routing of requests (service routing in
      [I-D.draft-sarathchandra-coin-appcentres-03])

   *  support the constraint-based selection of a specific service
      instance over others (constraint-based routing in
      [I-D.draft-sarathchandra-coin-appcentres-03])

   *  collective communication between multiple instances of AI services

   Research Questions:

   *  similar to use case in Section 5.1

   *  What are the communication patterns that may be supported by
      collective communication solutions?

   *  How to achieve scalable multicast delivery with rapidly changing
      receiver sets?

   *  What in-network capabilities may support the collective
      communication patterns found?

   *  How to provide a service routing capability that supports any
      invocation protocol (beyond HTTP)?

6.1.5.  Requirements

   Req 6.1.1: Any app-centric execution environment MUST provide means
   to specify the constraints for placing (AI) execution logic in
   certain logical execution points (and their associated physical
   locations).

   Req 6.1.2: Any app-centric execution environment MUST provide support
   for app/micro-service specific invocation protocols.

6.2.  Content Delivery Networks

6.2.1.  Description

   Delivery of content to end users often relies on Content Delivery
   Networks (CDNs) storing said content closer to end users for latency
   reduced delivery with DNS-based indirection being utilized to serve
   the request on behalf of the origin server.

Internet-Draft               COIN Use Cases                February 2021


6.2.2.  Characterization

   From the perspective of this draft, a CDN can be interpreted as a
   (network service level) application with distributed logic for
   distributing content from the origin server to the CDN ingress and
   further to the CDN replication points which ultimately serve the
   user-facing content requests.

6.2.3.  Existing Solutions

   NOTE: material on solutions will be added here later

   Studies such as those in [FCDN] have shown that content distribution
   at the level of named content, utilizing efficient (e.g., Layer 2)
   multicast for replication towards edge CDN nodes, can significantly
   increase the overall network and server efficiency.  It also reduces
   indirection latency for content retrieval as well as reduces required
   edge storage capacity by benefiting from the increased network
   efficiency to renew edge content more quickly against changing
   demand.

6.2.4.  Opportunities and Research Questions for COIN

   Opportunities:

   *  supporting service-level routing of requests (service routing in
      [I-D.draft-sarathchandra-coin-appcentres-03])

   *  support the constraint-based selection of a specific service
      instance over others (constraint-based routing in
      [I-D.draft-sarathchandra-coin-appcentres-03])

   *  supporting Layer 2 capabilities for multicast (compute
      interconnection and collective communication in
      [I-D.draft-sarathchandra-coin-appcentres-03])

   Research Questions: in addition to those for Section 5.1,

   *  how to utilize L2 multicast to improve on CDN designs?  How to
      utilize in-network capabilities in those designs?

   *  what forwarding methods may support the required multicast
      capabilities (see [FCDN])

   *  how could storage be traded off against frequent, multicast-based,
      replication (see [FCDN])

Internet-Draft               COIN Use Cases                February 2021


   *  what scalability limits exist for L2 multicast capabilities?  How
      to overcome them?

6.2.5.  Requirements

   Req 6.2.1: Any app-centric execution environment SHOULD utilize Layer
   2 multicast transmission capabilities for responses to concurrent
   service requests.

6.3.  CFaaS

6.3.1.  Description

   App-centric execution environments, consisting of Layer 2 connected
   data centres, provide the opportunity for infrastructure providers to
   offer CFaaS type of offerings to application providers.  Those app
   providers utilize the compute fabric exposed by this CFaaS offering
   for the purposes defined through their applications.  In other words,
   the compute resources can be utilized to execute the desired micro-
   services of which the application is composed, while utilizing the
   inter-connection between those compute resources to do so in a
   distributed manner.

6.3.2.  Characterization

   We foresee those CFaaS offerings to be tenant-specific, a tenant here
   defined as the provider of at least one application.  For this, we
   foresee an interaction between CFaaS provider and tenant to
   dynamically select the appropriate resources to define the demand
   side of the fabric.  Conversely, we also foresee the supply side of
   the fabric to be highly dynamic with resources being offered to the
   fabric through, e.g., user-provided resources (whose supply might
   depend on highly context-specific supply policies) or infrastructure
   resources of intermittent availability such as those provided through
   road-side infrastructure in vehicular scenarios.  The resulting
   dynamic demand-supply matching establishes a dynamic nature of the
   compute fabric that in turn requires trust relationships to be built
   dynamically between the resource provider(s) and the CFaaS provider.
   This also requires the communication resources to be dynamically
   adjusted to interconnect all resources suitably into the (tenant-
   specific) fabric exposed as CFaaS.

6.3.4.  Opportunities and Research Questions for COIN

   Opportunities:

   *  supporting service-level routing of requests (service routing in
      [I-D.draft-sarathchandra-coin-appcentres-03])

   *  support the constraint-based selection of a specific service
      instance over others (constraint-based routing in

   *  supporting Layer 2 capabilities for multicast (compute
      interconnection and collective communication in
      [I-D.draft-sarathchandra-coin-appcentres-03])

   Research Questions: similar to those for Section 5.1, in addition

   *  how to convey app-specific requirements for the creation of the L2
      fabric?

   *  how to dynamically integrate resources, particularly when driving
      by app-level requirements and changing service-specific
      constraints?

   *  how to utilize in-network capabilities to aid the availability and
      accountability of resources?

6.3.5.  Requirements

   Req 6.3.1: Any app-specific execution environment SHOULD expose means
   to specify the requirements for the tenant-specific compute fabric
   being utilized for the app execution.

   Req 6.3.2: Any app-specific execution environment SHOULD allow for
   dynamic integration of compute resources into the compute fabric
   being utilized for the app execution; those resources include, but
   are not limited to, end user provided resources.

   Req 6.3.3: Any app-specific execution environment MUST provide means
   to optimize the inter-connection of compute resources, including
   those dynamically added and removed during the provisioning of the
   tenant-specific compute fabric.

   Req 6.3.4: Any app-specific execution environment MUST provide means
   for ensuring availability and usage of resources is accounted for.

7.  Security Considerations

   Note: This section will need consolidation once new use cases are
   added to the draft.  Current in-network computing approaches
   typically work on unencrypted plain text data because today's
   networking devices usually do not have crypto capabilities.  As is
   already mentioned in Section 4.3.2, this above all poses problems
   when business data, potentially containing business secrets, is
   streamed into remote computing facilities and consequently leaves the
   control of the company.  Insecure on-premise communication within the
   company and on the shop-floor is also a problem as machines could be
   intruded from the outside.  It is thus crucial to deploy security and
   authentication functionality on on-premise and outgoing communication
   although this might interfere with in-network computing approaches.
   Ways to implement and combine security measures with in-network
   computing are described in more detail in [I-D.fink-coin-sec-priv].

8.  IANA Considerations

9.  Conclusion

   There are several domains that can profit from COIN.

   Industrial scenarios have unique sets of requirements mostly focusing
   around tight latency constraints with high required bandwidths.

   NOTE: Further aspects will be added once more use cases are added to
   the draft.
